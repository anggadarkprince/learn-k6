// Average-load tests assess how the system performs under a typical load for your system or application.
// Typical load might be a regular day in production or an average timeframe in your daily traffic.
// This test also might be called a day-in-life test or volume test.

// Average-load tests simulate the number of concurrent users and requests per second that reflect average
// behaviors in the production environment. This type of test typically increases the throughput or VUs gradually
// and maintains that average load for some time. Depending on the systemâ€™s characteristics, the test may stop
// suddenly or have a short ramp-down period.
