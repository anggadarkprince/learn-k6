// 1. smoke test: verify the system functions with minimal load.
// 2. average-load test: assess how the system performs under a typical load for your application.
// 3. stress test: discover how the system functions with the load at peak traffic.
// 4. spike test: verifies whether the system survives and performs under sudden and massive traffic.
// 5. breakpoint test: discover your systemâ€™s limits by running gradually load and see when system start failure.
// 6. soak test: variation of the average-load test, might call endurance test (run average-load in long time).
